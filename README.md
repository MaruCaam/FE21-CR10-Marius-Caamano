Dear trainers herewith I submit my tenth code review.

I made three pages that can be accessed through the navbar. Home which is the main page linked to the index.php, contact which is a basic contact page contact.php, the admin page is the create.php where and admin would be allowed to create new items.

You can edit and delete the files directly from the homepage by clicking the edit or delete button, this will redirect you to the pages mentioned above.

I added a "test" entry which is at the end of the page where I tested the creation of an entry as well as the editing. The deleting works as well it was tried out with another entry.

Thank you for reviewing my code! Have a great weekend!
